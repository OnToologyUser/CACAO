This class comprises agents, whether human individuals, groups, or non-human entities such as software applications, algorithms, or automated processes, that interact with digital systems or services by initiating actions, consuming resources, or producing outputs. Users are characterized by their capacity to perform intentional actions within a digital environment, for which they can be held responsible.​

Unlike E21 Person, which is limited to real or assumed human individuals, the class User encompasses a broader range of agents, including non-human actors that operate autonomously or semi-autonomously within digital contexts. This includes, but is not limited to, artificial intelligence models, automated scripts, and other algorithmic entities that engage with web services or digital platforms.​

The classification of an entity as a User does not necessitate legal personhood or consciousness; rather, it is based on the entity&apos;s functional role in interacting with digital systems in a manner that can be documented and attributed.​

Examples:
- A registered individual accessing an online museum catalog.​
- An AI-driven recommendation engine suggesting artifacts to users.​
- A software bot performing automated data curation tasks.​</rdfs:comment>

This class comprises identifiable immaterial items, such as digital images, texts, multimedia objects, computer program code, algorithms, or mathematical formulae, that are created, modified, or stored in digital formats. Digital Artefacts have an objectively recognizable structure and are documented as single units. They exist independently of specific physical carriers and can reside on multiple digital mediums simultaneously. While E73 Information Objects encompass a broad range of immaterial items, including those stored in human memory or on physical media, Digital Artefacts are specifically associated with digital technologies. This subclassification aids in distinguishing between general information entities and those uniquely tied to digital environments.​

Examples:
- A digital photograph of an ancient manuscript.​
- A 3D model of an archaeological excavation site.​
- The source code of a software application developed to catalog museum collections.​
- A dataset containing measurements of physical artefacts.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">From wikidata (Q49773): loosely organized effort by a large group of people to achieve a particular set of goals

Scope note:
A Social Movement is a loosely organized effort by a large group of people to achieve a particular set of goals, typically aiming to promote or resist changes in society&apos;s structure or values. These movements are characterized by collective action, where individuals unite based on shared beliefs or objectives, often seeking social, political, economic, or cultural transformations. ​

Social movements differ from formal organizations in that they may lack a defined organizational structure or formal membership, relying instead on informal networks and shared commitments. They can vary widely in size and scope, ranging from localized grassroots initiatives to large-scale national or international campaigns. The methods employed can include protests, demonstrations, advocacy, and other forms of collective action aimed at influencing public opinion and policy. ​

Examples:
- The Civil Rights Movement in the United States,
- The Environmental Movement
- The Feminist Movement,
- The LGBTQ+ Rights Movement</rdfs:comment>

Scope note:
A Political Movement is a collective effort by a group of people aiming to influence government policy, social values, or achieve specific political objectives. These movements are typically organized around particular issues or ideologies and seek to bring about change within the political system. They differ from political parties, which aim to gain political office, by focusing on specific goals rather than seeking electoral power. ​

Examples:
- The Anti-Apartheid Movement, which campaigned against the system of racial segregation in South Africa.​
- The Tea Party Movement in the United States, advocating for reduced government spending and taxation.​
- The Brexit Movement, which sought the United Kingdom&apos;s withdrawal from the European Union.</rdfs:comment>

This class comprises persons who are recognized for engaging in the creation or performance of works in the visual, performing, literary, or applied arts. This includes, but is not limited to, painters, sculptors, musicians, composers, writers, poets, actors, dancers, designers, and multimedia artists. An individual is regarded as an instance of Artist when there exists documented evidence of their engagement in artistic practices or when they are attributed with the authorship, performance, or conceptualization of artistic works, either by themselves or by third parties (such as curators, critics, or historical sources).

Artists may be associated with specific cultural movements, artistic periods, or creative practices. The classification of a Person as an Artist does not require professional status or formal recognition; amateur and self-taught individuals are also included when their artistic activity is documented and contextually significant.

In bibliographic or curatorial contexts, attribution of a creative work to an individual is sufficient to regard them as an Artist, even if the attribution is anonymous, pseudonymous, or contested.

Examples:
- Leonardo da Vinci
- Frida Kahlo
- William Shakespeare

This class comprises physical artefacts that are primarily created as expressions of aesthetic, conceptual, or symbolic intent. Artworks encompass a wide range of tangible objects produced through artistic practices, including but not limited to paintings, sculptures, installations, and mixed-media pieces.​

Artworks are distinguished by their purpose of conveying artistic expression, emotion, or commentary, rather than serving utilitarian functions. They are often characterized by their unique form, style, and the creative processes involved in their production.​

While all artworks are physical artefacts, not all physical artefacts qualify as artworks; the classification depends on the creator&apos;s intent and the cultural context attributing artistic value to the object.​
